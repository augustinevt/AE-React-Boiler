so,

webpack.... it's pretty intense... I'm glad I had a place to start.


I need to make a document for starting a project. not just boilerplate.


a complex project needs a way key. I methods I understand that I can use as context for other information.


I may want to MVP before getting caught up in the optimizing...

I'd like to learn more about docker




documenting and stuff


  before MVP

    let's see if we can deploy

    document schema
    document pertinent info (database stuff, schema, whatever)


  after mvp when you are adding "refactors".

  first: you should make a setup document on how to set up a project

    keep it referencing the survive stuff, but you need to take it into your own hands if you want to own it.

    as you add production stuff, add to this document



=====

ssh -i treeTest2.pem ec2-user@ec2-34-229-164-181.compute-1.amazonaws.com

The client is up... plan accordingly...
